# srl-data
These are the data for training preposition SRL models.
The ones named train.txt, development.txt, test.txt contain manually annotated data of governor and object.
The ones named train-dep.txt, dev-dep.txt, and test-dep.txt contain data annotated using a dependency parser (these labels came with the original STREUSLE data).
The file named wsj-test.txt contains out-of-domain, randomly selected WSJ sentences which have been manually annotated for governor and object in order to serve as a separate test set.
